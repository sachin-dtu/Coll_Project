INTRODUCTION
Lighting usage is a high part of the overall electricity consumption worldwide.
This is due to the use of a long time and it is an essential element of any building.
Normally, commercial buildings or rooms use light from 50% of total electricity
consumption in a country. In fact, for some buildings or rooms , over 90% of lighting
energy consumption has become unnecessary expenses due to greater illumination.
Therefore, the design of the lights is one of the important elements and it is the
beginning of the design for a building. Effective and efficient strategy of lighting
design, including natural daylighting, can give illumination at the proper level and
reduce the cost and energy. A lot of money can be saved if the designer knows how to
design a lighting system effectively and efficiently. In addition, it is also important,
because many problems may occur caused by poor lighting systems like eye strain.
In designing the lighting system, designers usually want to create a
comfortable environment to meet the needs of customers. Usually, the designer will
determine all the calculations involved in designing lighting systems manually like
lux calculation, number of luminaries, total cost and others. Most designers will
utilise simulation software to get the real view and reduce errors in design. All
calculations and simulations have to meet all correct specifications and standards. In
India, Indian standard lighting requirement (IN IEC) is taken as a reference in
designing the lighting system.
We’ll improve the lighting design of a room (here SPS12(room DTU-collage)).
The project has two main goals:
● to enhance the quality of illumination
● reduce costs.
The first goal of the project is to improve the quality of lighting in the SPS12 room.
This means ensuring that the light levels are appropriate for the activities that take
place in the room, that the lighting is evenly distributed throughout the space, and that
the colour rendering and temperature of the light are optimised for comfort and visual
appeal.
The second goal of the project is to reduce costs associated with the lighting system
in the SPS12 room. This includes reducing energy consumption, which can save
money on electricity bills, and reducing maintenance costs, which can help to extend
the lifespan of the lighting system and minimise the need for repairs or replacements.

B TECH PROJECT II

To achieve these objectives, the project will involve exploring various
strategies and technologies for optimising the lighting system in the SPS12 room.
This may include selecting more efficient light sources, such as LED lights, designing
more efficient lighting layouts, and implementing advanced controls and sensors to
automate the lighting system and adjust light levels based on occupancy and daylight
levels.
Overall, this project aims to demonstrate the importance of effective lighting
design in educational institutions, and how sustainability lighting solutions can
improve the quality of illumination while also reducing costs and promoting energy
efficiency.

THEORY
Colour & Wavelength
The energy radiation of the heated body is of one colour (or monochromatic), that
means, the radiation of only one wavelength emits a specific colour. The wavelength
of visible light varies from 4000 Å to 7500 Å.. The wavelengths and the
corresponding colours of the radiation are shown in Figure-2

Figure 2

Page 6

EE402

B TECH PROJECT II

Relative Sensitivity:
The reactive power of the human eye to the light waves of different wavelengths
varies from person to person and also varies with age. The human eye is most
sensitive to a wavelength of 5500 Å. Therefore, the relative sensitivity corresponding
to 5500 Å is taken as unity. The average relative sensitivity is shown in Figure-2. The
relative sensitivity at any particular wavelength is known as the relative luminous
factor, denoted by kλ.

Figure 3

Illumination is the amount of light that falls on a surface per unit area. It is a measure
of the brightness or luminance of a surface, which is determined by the amount of
light it reflects, absorbs, or transmits. Illumination is usually measured in lux or
foot-candles, which are units of luminous flux per unit area.

In simple terms, illumination refers to the level of lighting in a space, and it can affect
the mood, comfort, and functionality of the area. Illumination levels can vary
depending on the purpose of the space and the activities that take place in it. For
example, a workspace may require higher illumination levels than a relaxation area or
a bedroom.

Proper illumination is essential for creating a safe, comfortable, and visually
appealing environment. It can also have a significant impact on energy consumption
and cost, as excessive or inadequate illumination can waste energy or impair
visibility. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider and optimize illumination
levels when designing and managing indoor and outdoor spaces.
The formula for illumination is:

Page 7

EE402

B TECH PROJECT II

Illumination (E) = Luminous Flux (Φ) / Surface Area (A)
where:
Illumination (E) is the amount of light that falls on a surface per unit area, measured
in lux (lx) or foot-candles (fc).
Luminous Flux (Φ) is the total amount of light emitted by a light source, measured in
lumens (lm).
Surface Area (A) is the area of the surface that is being illuminated, measured in
square metres (m²) or square feet (ft²).
The formula shows that the illumination level is directly proportional to the luminous
flux and inversely proportional to the surface area. This means that as the luminous
flux increases or the surface area decreases, the illumination level increases.

For example, if a room has an area of 20 square metres and a light source that emits
2000 lumens of light, the illumination level can be calculated as follows:

E=Φ/A
E = 2000 lm / 20 m²
E = 100 lx

This means that the illumination level in the room is 100 lux, which is the amount of
light that falls on each square metre of the room's surface.

Reduction factor:
Reduction factor of a source of light is the ratio of its mean spherical candle power to
its mean horizontal candle power.
Reduction factor = M.S.C.P./M.H.C.P.
Lamp efficiency: It is defined as the ratio of the luminous flux to the power input. It
is expressed in lumens per watt.

Page 8

EE402

B TECH PROJECT II

Specific consumption:
It is defined as the ratio of the power input to the average candle power. It is
expressed in watts per candela.

Brightness :
When the eye receives a great deal of light from an object we say it is bright, and
brightness is an important quantity in illumination. It is all the same whether the light
is produced by the object or reflected from it. Brightness is defined as the luminous
intensity per unit projected area of either a surface source of light or a reflecting
surface and is denoted by L. If a surface area A has an effective luminous intensity of
I candelas in a direction θ to the normal, than the brightness (luminance) of that
surface is L = I/a cosθ The unit of brightness is candela/m2 (nits), candela/cm2 (stilb)
or candela/ft2

Glare:
The size of the opening of the pupil in the human eye is controlled by its iris. If the
eye is exposed to a very bright source of light the iris automatically contacts in order
to produce the amount of light admitted and prevent damage to retina this reduces the
sensitivity, so that other objects within the field of vision can be only imperfectly
seen. In other words glare may be defined as brightness within the field of vision of
such a character as the cause of annoyance discomfort interference with vision.

Space height ratio:
It is defined as the ratio of distance between adjacent lamps and height of their
mountains.

Utilisation factor or coefficient of utilisation:
It is defined as the ratio of total lumens reaching the working plane to total lumens
given out by the lamp.
Utilisation Factor = Total lumens reaching the working plane
total lumens given out by the lamp

Maintenance factor:

Page 9

EE402

B TECH PROJECT II

Due to accumulation of dust, dirt and smoke on the lamps, they emit less light than
that they emit when they are new ones and similarly the walls and ceilings e.t.c. after
being covered with dust, dirt and smoke do not reflect the same output of light, which
is reflected when they are new. The ratio of illumination under normal working
conditions to the illumination when the things are perfectly clean is known as
maintenance factor.
Maintenance Factor = Illumination under normal working conditions
illumination when everything is clear

Depreciation factor:
This is merely the reverse of the maintenance factor and is defined as the ratio of the
initial metre-candles to the ultimate maintained metre-candles on the working plane.
Its value is more than unity.

Waste light factor:
Whenever a surface is illuminated by a number of sources of light, there is always a
certain amount of waste of light on account of overlapping and falling of light outside
at the edges of the surface. The effect is taken into account by multiplying the
theoretical value of lumens required by 1.2 for rectangular areas and 1.5 for irregular
areas and objects such as statues, monuments etc.

Absorption factor:
In the places where the atmosphere is full of smoke fumes, such as in foundries, there
is a possibility of absorption of light. The ratio of total lumens available after
absorption to the total lumens emitted by the source of light is called the absorption
factor. Its value varies from unity for a clean atmosphere to 0.5 for foundries.

Beam factor:
The ratio of lumens in the beam of a projector to the lumens given out by lamps is
called the beam factor. This factor takes into account the absorption of light by the
reflector and front glass of the projector lamp. Its value varies from 0.3 to 0.6.

Page 10

EE402

B TECH PROJECT II

Reflection factor:
When a ray of light impinges on a surface it is reflected from the surface at an angle
of incidence, as shown in the following figure. A certain portion of incident light is
absorbed by the surface. The ratio of reflected light to the incident light is called the
reflection factor. Its value is always less than unity.

METHODOLOGY
There are a variety of methods that can be used to calculate the lighting from
the electrical source. The basics of calculating illuminance on a surface or the
luminaire of a surface are equal to the source of natural light and electric light
sources. In our work, we used two methods, namely simulation work by using
DIAlux Evo and AutoCAD, secondly by manual calculation based on the lumen
method.
Page 11

B TECH PROJECT II

To design the lighting systems in a building, the following information must be
obtained in advance: room length (L), room width (W), ceiling height (Hc),
suspension height (Hs), working plane height (Hw), ceiling colour, wall colour,
window condition, whether the room using fan or air-conditioned, around condition,
and type of room (lecturing, dining, etc). Then, select the type of lighting. These
types of lights are commonly used, such as downlight lamp, fluorescent, incandescent
lamps, contemporary type, lamp type of industry or lamp types of domestic.
However, the importance is the light generated by the lamps and how the light from
the lamps is transmitted. Fig. 1 shows the block diagram of entire procedures of this
research work. The lecturing room SPS-12 at dtu-college at Delhi was selected as the
case study of this work.

 an depend on the specific use of the space, but as a general guideline, educational
spaces such as classrooms and lecture halls typically require lighting levels between
300 and 500 lux (which is a unit of illumination). For the sake of this example, let's
assume that we want to achieve a lighting level of 400 lux throughout the room.
To determine the total lumens required for the room, we can use the following
formula:
Total Lumens = Area x Required Lux
Total Lumens = 216m² x 400 lux = 86,400 lumens
This means that we need a total of 86,400 lumens to achieve a lighting level of
400 lux throughout the room.
Assuming that we still want to achieve a lighting level of 400 lux throughout
the room, we can use the formula:
Number of bulbs = Total Lumens / Lumens per bulb
Page 13

EE402

B TECH PROJECT II

To calculate the total lumens required, we can use the same formula as before:
Total Lumens = Area x Required Lux
Total Lumens = 216m² x 400 lux = 86,400 lumens
Now, we can use the lumens per bulb to calculate how many bulbs are needed:
Number of bulbs = 86,400 lumens / 2400 lumens per bulb
Number of bulbs = 36 bulbs
So, if we are using light-bulbs with an output of 2400 lumens each, we would
need a total of 36 bulbs to achieve a lighting level of 400 lux throughout the SPS12
room. This is actually used in sps-12. And you can also see lighting design of sps-12

Figure 9: Illuminance isolines resulting in DIAlux Evo 3 simulation: R1

To reduce the number of bulbs and energy consumption while still maintaining
appropriate lighting levels in the SPS12 room, there are several strategies that can be
employed:
1. Use more efficient light bulbs: Consider using LED light bulbs, which
consume less energy and last longer than traditional incandescent bulbs. LED
bulbs can also be dimmed to adjust the lighting level as needed, further
reducing energy consumption.
2. Use natural light: Where possible, maximise the use of natural light in the
room by increasing the number and size of windows, or using skylights. This
can reduce the need for artificial lighting during the day and improve the
overall lighting quality in the room.

Page 16

EE402

B TECH PROJECT II

Use task lighting: Instead of relying on general overhead lighting for the entire room,
consider using task lighting for specific areas or workstations. This can reduce the
overall number of bulbs required while still providing adequate lighting for the task at
hand.
3. Use lighting controls: Install lighting controls such as occupancy sensors,
timers, and dimmers to help regulate the amount of light needed in the room.
This can further reduce energy consumption by turning off lights when they are
not needed, or dimming lights during times of lower activity.
By implementing these strategies, it is possible to reduce the number of bulbs
required and overall energy consumption while still maintaining appropriate lighting
levels in the SPS12 room.
Assuming that we still want to achieve a lighting level of 400 lux throughout the
room, we can use the same formula as before:
Total Lumens = Area x Required Lux
Total Lumens = 216m² x 400 lux = 86,400 lumens
Now, we can use the lumens per bulb to calculate how many bulbs are needed:
Number of bulbs = 86,400 lumens / 3400 lumens per bulb
Number of bulbs = 25.41 or 26 bulbs
So, if we are using light-bulbs with an output of 3400 lumens each, we would need a
total of 26 bulbs to achieve a lighting level of 400 lux throughout the SPS12 room.
However, since we cannot use a fraction of a bulb, we would need to round up to 27
bulbs to ensure adequate lighting.

Figure 10

Page 17

EE402

B TECH PROJECT II

Figure 11: Illuminance isolines resulting in DIAlux Evo 3 simulation: R2

Figure 12

Now, we need to calculate the total energy consumption for each case:
Case 1: 2400 lumen, 24-watt bulb
Number of bulbs required = 36
Total power consumption = 36 bulbs x 24 watts per bulb = 864 watts

Page 18

EE402

B TECH PROJECT II

Case 2: 3400 lumen, 24-watt bulb
Number of bulbs required = 27 (rounded up from 25.41 bulbs)
Total power consumption = 27 bulbs x 24 watts per bulb = 648 watts
Now, let's calculate the energy consumption per year assuming 6 hours of use per day
and an electricity rate of Rs.6 per kilowatt-hour:

Case 1:
Energy consumption per day = 864 watts x 6 hours = 5.184 kilowatt-hours
(kWh)
Energy consumption per year = 5.184 kWh x 365 days = 1892.16 kWh
Cost per year = 1892.16 kWh x Rs6/kWh = Rs.11352.96

Case 2:
Energy consumption per day = 648 watts x 6 hours = 3.888 kWh
Energy consumption per year = 3.888 kWh x 365 days = 1,419.12 kWh
Cost per year = 1419.12 kWh x Rs6/kWh = Rs 8514
Comparing the two cases, we can see that using the 3400 lumen, 24-watt bulb would
result in an annual energy consumption of 1,419.12 kWh, which is 473.04 kWh (or
approximately 25%) less than the annual energy consumption of 1892.16 kWh for the
2400 lumen, 24-watt bulb. This translates to an annual cost savings of approximately
Rs 2838.8.
Therefore, using the 3400 lumen, 24-watt bulb would result in lower energy
consumption and cost savings compared to using the 2400 lumen, 24-watt bulb in the
SPS12 room.

FUTURE SCOPE
We plan to look forward to the possibility of enhancing our proposed design by
looking forward to the effects of diffused reflection, also we may introduce using
light reflecting paints afterwards
We could then use a linear programming solver to find the optimal solution that meets
all of these constraints while minimising energy consumption and costs. The optimal
solution would specify the number and placement of light fixtures in the room that
would achieve the desired lighting level while minimising energy consumption and
costs, taking into account the amount of natural daylight entering the room and the
reflectivity of the room's surfaces.

FUTURE SCOPE
In the future, there are several possibilities to enhance the proposed design. One option is to investigate the effects of diffused reflection on the lighting design. Additionally, using light-reflecting paints could be considered as another improvement. By exploring these factors, it may be possible to further optimize the lighting design and improve the overall lighting quality in the room.

Another potential avenue for improvement is to utilize linear programming solvers. These tools can help find an optimal solution that meets all the constraints while minimizing energy consumption and costs. By considering factors such as the amount of natural daylight entering the room and the reflectivity of the room's surfaces, a linear programming solver could determine the optimal number and placement of light fixtures in the room to achieve the desired lighting level with the least energy consumption and costs.

Abstract:
This project focuses on the lighting design and energy optimization for an educational space, specifically the SPS12 room. The aim is to achieve appropriate lighting levels while minimizing energy consumption and costs. The project utilizes DIALux evo software for lighting design simulation and calculations.

The project begins by determining the required lighting level of 400 lux throughout the room, based on the specific use of the space. The total lumens required are calculated using the formula: Total Lumens = Area x Required Lux. By considering the lumens per bulb, the number of bulbs needed is determined.

To reduce energy consumption, several strategies are explored. These include using more efficient light bulbs, maximizing natural light through windows and skylights, and implementing task lighting and lighting controls. The benefits of each strategy in terms of energy savings are discussed.

Comparing two cases with different bulb specifications (2400 lumens, 24-watt bulb and 3400 lumens, 24-watt bulb), the annual energy consumption and cost savings are calculated. The results demonstrate that using the 3400 lumen bulb results in lower energy consumption and cost savings compared to the 2400 lumen bulb.

The project concludes by suggesting future enhancements, such as considering the effects of diffused reflection and exploring the use of light-reflecting paints. Additionally, the utilization of linear programming solvers is proposed to optimize the lighting design by considering natural daylight and surface reflectivity.

The findings of this project provide valuable insights into achieving appropriate lighting levels with reduced energy consumption and costs in educational spaces. The knowledge gained can contribute to sustainable and efficient lighting design practices.

Abstract:
This research paper presents a comprehensive study on lighting design and energy optimization for an educational space, specifically focusing on the SPS12 room. The objective is to achieve optimal lighting levels while minimizing energy consumption and costs. The investigation employs DIALux evo software for accurate lighting design simulations and calculations.

The research begins by establishing the desired lighting level of 400 lux throughout the room, considering its specific purpose and requirements. By utilizing the formula: Total Lumens = Area x Required Lux, the total lumens required for the space are calculated. Furthermore, the number of bulbs needed is determined based on the lumens per bulb specification.

To reduce energy consumption, several strategies are explored and analyzed. These include the implementation of more efficient LED light bulbs, maximizing the utilization of natural light through increased window area and skylights, and employing task lighting and lighting controls. The potential energy savings and benefits of each strategy are discussed in detail.

A comparative analysis is conducted between two scenarios: one utilizing 2400 lumen, 24-watt bulbs and the other employing 3400 lumen, 24-watt bulbs. The research evaluates the annual energy consumption and cost savings associated with each scenario. The results demonstrate that using the 3400 lumen bulbs results in significantly reduced energy consumption and cost savings compared to the 2400 lumen bulbs.

In addition, the research proposes future enhancements to the project, such as considering the effects of diffused reflection and investigating the use of light-reflecting paints. Furthermore, it suggests employing linear programming solvers to optimize the lighting design by incorporating variables such as natural daylight availability and surface reflectivity.

The findings of this research contribute to the body of knowledge in sustainable lighting design practices for educational spaces. The study showcases the feasibility and benefits of achieving appropriate lighting levels while minimizing energy consumption and costs. The research outcomes can inform architects, lighting designers, and facility managers in making informed decisions for energy-efficient lighting design in educational environments.
